# BuildAPC Sales Displayer

A React web application that fetches API from Reddit, specifically the buildapcsales subreddit, using Axios. 

The user interface was made and stylized through MUI (Material UI), a React library that simplifies the user interface implementation.



The project can be downloaded/cloned and then ran by going to:
> https://localhost:3000



**NOTE:**
This is still an ongoing project but the functionality is there.
